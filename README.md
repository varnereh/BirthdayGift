# A gift for my lovely girlfriend, who I adore cooking with. 
# This is a website meant for a phone, as she generally uses her phone for storing recipes.
# It is her birthday, and I figured something special like this would be a lot more exciting than a dusty old app from the app store.
# Might not be as polished as those, but it sure is heartfelt!

# Utilizes Github Actions and Vercel to securely and, at least to me, interestingly allow my girlfriend to submit recipes to this app.
